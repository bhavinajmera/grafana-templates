This repo is simply a dumping ground for some interesting Grafana scripted dashboard ideas... for now.

At present, I've only included a simple "wrapper" dashboard script that will source in a "template" script based on the `template` URL argument.

To use these in your Grafana install (>= 1.6.1), just add `cboggs_demo.js` to <grafana_home>/app/dashboards/, and `jdk_8.js` to <grafana_home>/.

Appropriate arguments are commented in the top of `cboggs_demo.js`.

More to come!
